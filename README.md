# JS-color-palette-picker
#Made by ELiana Lopez Bahlcke on June 2021#
This little project is made with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

You can choose your favorite color palette and save it for future browser sessions! It's very simple to use.
It is a simple but complete web app. It was made using powerful tools like manipulating events in the DOM, and saving data in the LocalStorage. 
It's interactive and fully working.
